# Maintenance-scheduling-with-genetic-algorithms

a genetic algorithm project requirement for Programming Languages

12/13/23 7:19am: Added a population function and changed the logic of finding the total capacity since it should have a fixed size rather than a dynamically allocated

12/13/23 8:32am: Added a selection, crossover, and mutation function to have the genetic algorithm feature

12/13/23 11:22am: changed the logic of adding the total installed capacity to be dynamic based on the given unit data
